			<h1> One of the things that I enjoy the most in live is Traveling! From the early childhood, 
			my dream was to visit all the places in the world and this dream still keeps me going.
			For the last 3 years I managed to visit around 10 countries on two continents and this is 
			just a part of my overall traveling experience. I decided to share below two of my most 
			memorable adventures...
			</h1>
			<h2> SWEDEN</h2>
			<img src="Malmo.jpg" width="650" height="450";>
			<p> I visited Malmo in Spring 2017 on my way to Macedonia. The thing is that on my way from Vilnius
				to Skopje, I had a layover of 12 hours in Malmo's airport and me and my girlfriend decided to use 
				our time smartly and instead of dying from boredom in the airport, to explore one more beautiful 
				city. However, we forgot that while preparing for the trip to Macedonia we left all the warm clothes 
				home (assuming that is going to be warm in Skopje) and now we had to walk and freeze on -3 C all day!
				Ohh.. I remember it was very cold and veeeeery windy! Of course we tried to improvise and dressed 
				several liars of different T-shirts and sweaters, but unfortunately that did not save us from cruel 
				Swedish weather. The begging sounds a bit sad, but we actually had a great time after. As soon as we 
				arrived in the old town from the airport we forgot about how cold it was ! The city was so beautiful 
				and it had so much to offer that we could not stay in one place. So for the next 12 hours we were constantly 
				walking and exploring the beauty of Malmo (with the exception of some stops for food and coffee). By the end of
				the day we managed to see everything we had to (Art Gallery, History Museum, Malmo Castle, etc.) and spend
				a quality time! If you ever have a layover of 10+ hours in Malmo, I would definitely recommend to go for a walk!

			<h2> MACEDONIA </h2>
			<img src="Macedonia.jpg" width="750" height="450";>
			<p> I got to visit Macedonia in Spring 2017 as well and it was the 3rd country that I have visited on Balkans.
				Trip to Macedonia was very memorable for several reasons, but one of the main reason why it was so special- because it was unexpected.
				Prior to booking tickets to Macedonia, me and my girlfriend were planning for several weeks our trip to Talin and Helsinki,because this was 
				the initial plan. Now two of my girlfriend's friends came to visit us in Lithuania and we arranged on weekend to go to Ryga. Then, one evening
				we were sitting at the table and talking, and one of the friends (she studies in Greece) was confused why would we want to go somewhere, where it
				is the same cold as in Lithuania. Then she proposed to visit her in Greece, whenever we have a chance, because we could have an opportunity to warm 
				our bones. Suddenly, one of the girls (don't remember which one) suggested to just take a look at the tickets, with the thought that maybe it is possible to 
				find some cheap connections. And guess what :D After about 20 minutes playing with different connections we booked our tickets to Greece (through Macedonia). 
				I hope this was not very confusing. We went to Macedonia, when the final destination was Greece! And yeah coming back to Macedonia, I spent a very nice time 
				there, tried tasty food, saw beautiful places, met my girlfriend's mom and most important - I went up on a mountain for the first time in my life ! P.S: unexpected 
				trips - are the best trips!
